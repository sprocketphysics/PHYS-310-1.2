# Relativistic transformations in 3D!
## Introduction
This assignment is adapted from an episode of Let's Code Physics by Brian Lane. His vlog is inspired by Twitch vlogs, but instead of watching Pewdie Pie play video games, you're listening to a physics professor talking through his process in writing some cool codes! I had dinner with Brian once, he's a nice guy.

Here is a [link to his episode](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=lets+code+physics+relativistic&view=detail&mid=9F2CEF5AF94B9C8977969F2CEF5AF94B9C897796&FORM=VIRE).

My comment to him is that the contraction of space should actually be viewed from the reference frame in which the particle is at rest, and he thought of a simple way to do that: just let the ball be the center of the view. Now it's not an inertial reference frame, so this might not be exactly right. We are also not taking into account the "time of flight" of photons leaving each box on the grid to arrive at the viewer. 

## Setting up Git on your computer
You will need to install git for this course. In Windows, download and install Github Desktop. On a Mac or Linux you can do this all from the command line. The annoying thing about windows is that it may be hard to find your local folder for downloaded Github repositories, so pay attention to the step where you set the Github directory.

Create a GitHub account too. When choosing your user name, plan on using one that won't cause embarassment to use for your first job.

Git is a "version control" protocol, which means that it is a way to maintain versions of a file directory on multiple servers. It makes it simple for the changes made on one server to be "pushed" to other servers, so that the servers can remain in sync. Git is used by coworkers to collaborate very efficiently, and we are learning to use it for a good reason! It will help in grad school and it will help in the workplace. 

## Instructions to pull this assignment and turn it in with a git "push"
Your instructions are to 
1. "pull" this repository from Github.com (the "origin"). Then you'll have your own local copy of the repository. 
2. Create a fork with your name. 
3. Then "commit" (which means save a version locally) and 
4. don't forget to "push", which means to push that version back to the "origin" (which is Github.com in this case).

This is the simple workflow for using Git. Don't be overwhelmed and think that you need to know everything that can be done with git. Just learn this simple workflow first. That is the backbone of what git is for, and yes it can do a lot more.

If you don't have Python installed on your computer, I recommend downloading anaconda python and installing it with the defaults.
